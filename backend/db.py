"""PostgreSQL (Supabase) connection helper — pool-backed.

Uses psycopg_pool.ConnectionPool so every request reuses an already-open
connection instead of paying a 200-400 ms TCP+SSL handshake on each call.

Pool settings (both pools use dict_row so callers get named columns):
  min_size=1  — keep 1 connection warm at idle
  max_size=8  — stays within Supabase free tier limit (~60 concurrent)
  prepare_threshold=None — required for PgBouncer transaction mode (port 6543)

All callers continue to use get_conn() as a context manager:

    with get_conn() as conn:
        cur = conn.cursor()
        ...  # rows are dicts: row["columnName"]
