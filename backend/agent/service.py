"""Agentic conversational query engine -- Phase 1 entry point.

Generalizes the PAL neuro-symbolic architecture (docs/components/component-3.md)
from a single rigid plan-execute-answer cycle into a multi-turn, tool-calling
conversation: the LLM still only *plans* by calling deterministic tools
(agent/tools.py); it never computes a number itself (agent/guard.py is the
last-line-of-defense check). Conversation memory persists per `thread_id`
(agent/memory.py). Tenant isolation is preserved exactly like the legacy/PAL
engines: user_id is bound into the tools server-side, never an LLM-suppliable
argument (CLAUDE.md "Architecture Invariants").

Stage A additions (docs/phase3-retirement-plan.md): each turn also returns a
`trace` -- the tool calls the agent actually made (name, args, result summary),
which IS the derivation trace for the UI: exactly what was computed, with what
filters, from how many rows. The turn (messages + evidence + trace) is
persisted to the chat_thread/chat_message registry (agent/threads.py) for
ChatGPT-style thread listing and replay.

Runs alongside the existing /ask-query (pal_qa.answer_financial_question)
without touching it -- see app.py's AGENT_QUERY_ENGINE_ENABLED flag.
