"""Component 3 — orchestrator: Scope Resolver -> Planner -> Validator ->
Executor -> Answer Generator (docs/components/component-3.md "Flow"), wired
into the live /ask-query endpoint (app.py).

Falls back to the pre-PAL ad-hoc logic (data_tools.analyze_financial_query +
ai_helper.generate_explainable_answer) whenever PAL can't confidently
answer: the query LLM is unavailable, the plan never validates within the retry
budget, the question doesn't map to one of PAL's arithmetic tasks (e.g.
"list my invoices"), or the validated plan matched zero rows. This keeps
every existing live query working while adding hallucination-free
arithmetic with citations for the cases PAL covers -- the same
"deterministic fallback when the LLM can't be trusted" philosophy as
ocr_correction.safe_correct() and ai_helper.build_fallback_answer.
